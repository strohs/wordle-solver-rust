# Rust Wordle Solver
This branch contains an optimized version of a wordle solver called, "roget", written by Jon Gjenset with contributions
from other members of the rust community. I'm keeping as a separate branch for educational purposes.

The original github repo is [here](https://github.com/jonhoo/roget.git)
